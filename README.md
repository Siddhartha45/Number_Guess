# Number_Guess
There is a certain number that the user have to guess.
The program will ask user to input the correct number. If our input number does not match, then the program will guide us by telling if our input number was greater or lesser than the correct number. 
However the user can guess the number for ten times only. After ten tries the program will quit by showing the right number.
But if the user guesses the right number before ten tries the program will congragulate them, show their number of tries and then quit.
